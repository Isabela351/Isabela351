### 🎯 Featured Project: Bias Detection for Meta 
🔗 *Project README:* https://github.com/Meta-Fall-AI-Studio/Meta1A-Bias-Detection/blob/main/README.md

As part of Break Through Tech’s Fall AI Studio with Meta, my team and I developed a machine learning model to classify biased vs. non-biased text.

**What We Did:** Collected, cleaned, and merged multiple bias-related datasets, then fine-tuned a RoBERTa-based classifier to detect biased vs. non-biased text. Implemented class weighting and evaluated model performance with confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, and standard metrics (accuracy, F1, precision, recall).  

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch  

**Result:**
